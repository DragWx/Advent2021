# Advent of Code 2021
https://adventofcode.com/2021

Hi, I'm [@DragWx](https://github.com/DragWx), and these are my solutions for Advent of Code 2021. They're written in TypeScript and don't use any additional libraries or packages. See `NOTES.md` for my commentary on each day.

## Running
Build the project, then open `index.html`. Select the day and phase from the dropdowns, paste the puzzle input on the left, click the `[RUN]` button, read the results on the right.

The UI will get more and more \~festive\~ as I get bored. :D

I'm using Firefox to run this, so compatibility with other browsers is not guaranteed.

## Commits
Starting with `day05`, there will be at least two commits per puzzle: One immediately following when my phase 1 output passes, and then the same for phase 2. There may be other commits in between or following, but there will at least be those two.
