# Advent of Code 2021
https://adventofcode.com/2021

Hi, I'm [@DragWx](https://github.com/DragWx), and these are my solutions for Advent of Code 2021. They're written in TypeScript and don't use any additional libraries or packages.

## Running
Build the project, then open `index.html`. Select the day and phase from the dropdowns, paste the puzzle input on the left, click the `[RUN]` button, read the results on the right.

The UI will get more and more ~festive~ as I get bored. :D
